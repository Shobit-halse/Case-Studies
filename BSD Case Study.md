• Understanding the Development Models:
The BSD License allows developers to create both open-source and closed-source software using BSD-licensed code.It promotes flexibility in development models, as it does not impose the strict copyleft requirements found in the GPL.This flexibility encourages a wide range of software projects and collaborations, including both open-source and proprietary developments.

• Licensing:
BSD License is permissive, meaning that developers can use, modify, and redistribute BSD-licensed code with relatively few restrictions.
It primarily requires that the original copyright notice and the license text be retained in derivative works.This permissive nature makes it attractive for both open-source and commercial software projects.

• Mode of Funding:
Funding for BSD-licensed projects can come from various sources, including donations, grants, corporate support, and individual contributions.
Organizations and individuals can choose to support BSD-licensed projects based on their alignment with project goals and objectives.

• Commercial/Non-Commercial:
The BSD License is highly permissive and allows for the inclusion of BSD-licensed code in commercial software without imposing additional restrictions.It is equally suitable for non-commercial and academic projects, offering broad applicability.
