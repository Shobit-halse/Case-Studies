Understanding the Development Models:
Wikipedia uses a collaborative and decentralized development model, allowing anyone with internet access to edit its articles. It's powered by MediaWiki, an open-source software platform, and relies on a diverse community of volunteers from around the world who contribute their time and expertise to create and maintain the content.

Licensing:
Wikipedia's content is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license, ensuring its availability for anyone to use, share, and adapt as long as they provide attribution and share derivative works under the same license. This open licensing has contributed to Wikipedia's widespread adoption and content availability.

Mode of Funding:
Wikipedia is funded by donations from individuals and organizations, with the Wikimedia Foundation managing finances and resources. Regular fundraising campaigns secure funding for infrastructure, servers, and staff, ensuring Wikipedia's commitment to ad-free content and maintaining its commitment to ad-free content.

Commercial/Non-Commercial:
Wikipedia itself is a non-commercial project. It does not display ads on its pages, and its primary goal is to provide free and reliable information to the public. However, the Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees Wikipedia, may receive donations and grants from various organizations and individuals to support its operations. These funds are used to cover the costs of running and maintaining the Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia.
